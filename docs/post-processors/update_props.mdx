# JFrog Artifactory Post-Processor

Type:  `artifactory-update-props`

The Artifactory post-provisioner `artifactory-update-props` is used to assign one or more properties to an artifact within Artifactory.


## Advisements
* If the property key already exists on the artifact, the new value will simply be updated.

* If an incorrectly case property key is passed to the artifact, the artifact will treat that property as a completely separate property.


## Housekeeping
* Artifactory property key/values, artifact URIs, download URIs, Artifactory paths (/repo/folder/...), and file names are **CASE SENSITIVE**. There are a few exceptions, however, it's best to assume case sensitivity for successful outcomes. This is a behavior of the Artifactory API and not something we can control.


## Configuration Reference

- `artifactory_server` (string) - Required; The API address of the Artifactory server (ex: https://server.domain.com:8081/artifactory/api). The URL will differ slightly between cloud-hosted and self-hosted instanced.
    * Environment variable: `ARTIFACTORY_SERVER`
- `artifactory_token` (string) - Required; The Artifactory account Identity Token used to authenticate with the Artifactory server and perform operations. Results are limited to whatever the account has access to. If the account can only "see" a single repository, then the results will only include content from that single repository.
    * Environment variable: `ARTIFACTORY_TOKEN`
- `artifact_uri` (string) - Required; The URI of the artifact.
- `properties` (map[string]string) - Required; The key/value pairs of one or more properties to apply to the artifact. Even if the property key already exists, the value will simply be updated.
** NOTE: Property key/values are CASE SENSITIVE. Therefore, passing incorrectly cased property keys will create a NEW property in that case. 

For example, if `testartifact.txt` has the key/value property of 'release=latest-stable' and the key/value property 'RELEASE=stable' is passed to this same artifact, the artifact will then have BOTH entries rather than updating the original. It will have:
- release = latest-stable
- RELEASE = stable


## Output Data

None


## Basic Example Usage

**Update Artifact with Single Property**
```hcl
	post-processor "artifactory-update-props" {
		artifactory_token     = var.artif_token  
    	artifactory_server    = var.artif_server
			
		artifact_uri = "${var.artif_server}/storage/test-packer-plugin/test-artifact.txt"
		properties   = {
			release = "latest-stable"
		}
	}
```

**Update Artifact with Multiple Properties**
```hcl
	post-processor "artifactory-update-props" {
		artifactory_token     = var.artif_token  
    	artifactory_server    = var.artif_server 
			
		artifact_uri = "${var.artif_server}/storage/test-packer-plugin/test-artifact.txt"
		properties   = {
			release = "latest-stable"
			testing = "passed"
		}
	}
```
