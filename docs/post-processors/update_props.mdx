# JFrog Artifactory Post-Processor

Type:  `artifactory-update-props`

## Configuration Reference

- `artifactory_server` (string) - Required; The API address of the Artifactory server (ex: https://server.domain.com:8081/artifactory/api). The URL will differ slightly between cloud-hosted and self-hosted instanced.
