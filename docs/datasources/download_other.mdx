# JFrog Artifactory Data Source

The Artifactory data source is used to download any supporting artifacts that go with a given image file (type OVA, OVF, or VMTX). This could be scripts, metadata, documents, etc. No files files are converted or imported into vCenter as part of this.

This data source differs from the `artifactory-import` data source in that the `artifactory-import` process is used to download OVA, OVF, or VMTX files which are comprised of one or more specific files, depending on the image type. Depending on the image type, the associated files are determined, validated, and optionally downloaded before being converted to VMX, imported into vCenter, and marked as a VM Template.


## Configuration Reference

- `artifactory_server` (string) - Required; The API address of the Artifactory server (ex: https://server.domain.com:8081/artifactory/api). The URL will differ slightly between cloud-hosted and self-hosted instanced.
    * Environment variable: `ARTIFACTORY_SERVER`
- `artifactory_token` (string) - Required; The Artifactory account Identity Token used to authenticate with the Artifactory server and perform operations. Results are limited to whatever the account has access to. If the account can only "see" a single repository, then the results will only include content from that single repository.
    * Environment variable: `ARTIFACTORY_TOKEN`
- `logging` (string) - Optional; The logging level to use (INFO, WARN, ERROR, DEBUG). This defaults to 'INFO' if left blank.
    * Environment variable: `LOGGING`
- `output_dir` (string) - Required; The directory where the artifacts should be downloaded to; ensure this is properly escaped as necessary.
    * Environment variable: `OUTPUTDIR`
- `artifactory_path` (string) - Required; The repo path within Artifactory where the artifact(s) to be downloaded reside(s) (ex: /repo/folder).
- `file_list` ([]string) - Required; The list of file names with extensions to be downloaded; each file should be in quotes.
